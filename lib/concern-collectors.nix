# Compile the collectors concern (`den.collectors.<name>`, spec §4.7) onto the framework `collector` entity
# kind. A collector is a FIRST-CLASS ENTITY — it carries its own class content, an id_hash, and a root scope
# node — so it is a real gen-schema kind (`collector`), not a bare data record. The kind is FRAMEWORK-OWNED:
# it enters `denMeta` by a `//`-augment GATED on `den.collectors != {}` (a fleet with no collectors has no
# collector kind/registry — corpus-inert), and `entity.discoverKinds` reserves the name against a user kind.
#
# The collector's producing class is a PER-INSTANCE FUNCTION of its own `class` field (§2.5's function-form
# `contentClass`, the shim's per-host precedent): `contentClassFn e = effectiveClassEntries.${e.class}`, so
# distinct collectors carry distinct classes. Both failure modes abort catchable-NAMED — an ABSENT/null class
# (null-guarded BEFORE any string selector, because a null attr selector `x.${null}` is a tryEval-uncatchable
# coercion the `or` never intercepts) and a non-null UNREGISTERED class — at the compiled surface (eager) AND
# the classOf path.
#
# NO EFFECT RUNTIME (Law A1): every export is pure wiring — a freeform names probe (the discoverClasses
# idiom), a schema-decl + bridge module, a `//`-augment, a `mapAttrs` validation, a lookup-with-guard.
