# Declaration constructors — the four concern vocabularies as tagged, INERT graph facts
# (r2 §B2/§B3). NAMING (verb/noun split): this module binds as `declare` — a VERB, so a
# policy body reads `declare.member { … }` — while the node ATTRIBUTE that holds the facts a
# rule produced is `declarations` — a NOUN, the facts present at a node. File name and both
# names spell "declaration"; only the grammatical role differs.
#
# A declaration is `{ __action = <kind>; … }` built on gen-dispatch.mkActions. Its KIND is the
# tag (`spawn`/`link`/`member`/`edge`/…); its STRATUM (B2: structural | resolution | collection
# | demand) is the mkActions GROUP the kind sits in — `stratumOf` returns it and `kindToStratum`
# is the static kind→stratum map. NO EFFECT RUNTIME: a declaration is data, never a callable;
# the only callables ever inside one are the guards gen-dispatch reads. Identity law (A2):
# entry-typed positions (member coords, configure.of, edge, demand.subject) reject a "kind:name"
# scope-string or a provenance `rendered` display value, taking only registry entries (carrying
# `id_hash`). The check is EAGER — a bad input aborts at construction (WHNF), not lazily when the
# field is later read — so `builtins.tryEval` over the bare constructor call already catches it.

  #     the native/fixture form (a cell materialises under the product).
  #   • WRAPPED — `member { coords = { … }; bindings ? { }; containTo ? null }` — the tuple that carries
  #     ctx `bindings` and (when `containTo != null`) marks a CONTAINMENT tuple: the STAGED ROOT-RESOLUTION
  #     pre-pass folds `bindings` into the target root's ctx AND records the source coordinate as that
  #     root's containment ancestor (the env→host / env→cluster edge — the settings-chain env slice), NEVER
  #     a product cell. `containTo` names the coord kind that is the EXISTING ROOT target (`coords.<containTo>`
  #     is its identity entry; `coords` minus it is the source slice). The COMPAT `resolve.to` arm sets
  #     `containTo` for a registry-backed (root) target and leaves it null for a registry-less (cell) target
  #     — the node-class law (compile.nix); a native fixture sets it explicitly.
  # The WRAPPED shape is detected structurally (an attrset holding `coords` whose OWN keys are all reserved
  # {coords,bindings,containTo}); every other attrset is bare coords. A fleet kind named `coords`/`bindings`/
  # `containTo` is the only ambiguity — none exist (kinds are host/user/env/…). Each coordinate is
