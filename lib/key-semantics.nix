# Shape B — the ONE keySemantics vocabulary builder (gen-aspects `cnf.keySemantics`). gen-aspects builds
# every declared aspect key's option GENERICALLY from this map: `class → deferredModule`, `channel → raw
# passthrough`, `facet → the entry's own option/module`. den-hoag declares its whole aspect vocabulary
# through here, so an aspect key's semantics live in ONE place (fixes the old parallel `classes` +
# `channelModules` + `aspectModules` split, and lets `classifyKey` read category off the same source).
#
# This file owns only the CLASS + CHANNEL half — the categories every consumer of the aspect schema shares
# (identical class + fleet-quirk vocabulary, so a quirk-channel key never falls to freeform). FACET entries
# (neededBy/settings/id_hash) carry caller-specific modules and are merged in by each caller (the aspects
# concern supplies its three facet modules; the identity-view consumers supply none).
