# The ONE keySemantics vocabulary builder (gen-aspects `cnf.keySemantics`). gen-aspects builds
# every declared aspect key's option GENERICALLY from this map: `class → deferredModule`, `channel → raw
# passthrough`, `facet → the entry's own option/module`. den-hoag declares its whole aspect vocabulary
# through here, so an aspect key's semantics live in ONE place (a single source for the class + channel +
# facet vocabulary, from which `classifyKey` also reads a key's category).
#
# This file owns the CLASS + CHANNEL half (`mkClassChannelSemantics`) — the categories every consumer of the
# aspect schema shares (identical class + fleet-quirk vocabulary, so a quirk-channel key never falls to
# freeform) — AND the SHARED FACET-VOCABULARY half (`mkFacetSemantics`): the `neededBy`/`settings`/`artifact`
# facet keySemantics MODULES, in ONE source so the aspect concern and every typed-view consumer mount the SAME
# facet option types (a `.settings` block is `lazyAttrsOf raw` wherever the vocabulary is registered, never
# freeform-absorbed as a nested aspect). `id_hash` is NOT a shared facet here — it is gen-aspects' native
# universal content-address option (types.nix `default = aspectId (cnf.providerPrefix or []) config`), so
# both the aspect concern and the identity-view consumers inherit it from the aspect type, not this vocabulary.
