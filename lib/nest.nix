# The nest-mode EXECUTION engine (spec §4.2 mode taxonomy) — the live-edge counterpart to the receives
# registry. `receivers.nix` DECLARES the graft-site rule (the `at` placement, the `consumes` product, the
# derived `mode`) and resolves slot ≻ class; THIS module EXECUTES it on a resolved nest edge, turning a
# compiled row + the inner entity's product face into a mode-tagged CONTRIBUTION the caller places. The MLIR
# dialect-conversion reading: each mode is a lowering from the product's typed carrier into the outer
# assembly's dialect (content ⇒ a module list at the graft path, artifact ⇒ a rendered face, extend ⇒ an
# extendModules handle, value ⇒ a verbatim injection). The Backpack / F-ing-modules content-vs-artifact
# distinction is the spine: a CONTENT contribution carries the raw module face (unit body, still open to
# further merge at the mount), an ARTIFACT one carries a render THUNK (a sealed, already-elaborated result).
#
# NO EFFECT RUNTIME (Law A1): `executeNest` is a `mode` dispatch + a pure attrset assembly per arm — no
# fixpoint, no gen-graph walk (the dispatch that PICKED the row already ran in `resolveReceiver`). It reads
# the compiled row's DERIVED `mode` field (never re-derives from `consumes` — F1's canonical machine form is
# computed once, at registry compile). NIXPKGS-FREE: the sole nixpkgs crossing in the output stratum is
# output/terminal.nix; the engine wires module faces without evaluating them, so it never touches nixpkgs.
#
# THE §2.1 HOOK-SCOPING COROLLARY (the row contract, mirrored from receivers.nix): the engine may not force
# `inner.payload` during wiring — a contribution carries the payload lazily (the S-hashing law: a produced
# value never enters the structural fill, only the producing node's structural reference does). `at` is
# handed STRUCTURAL handles only — the paramPoint (`ctx.paramPoint`) and the inner's structural FACE with
# the payload STRIPPED (`removeAttrs inner [ "payload" ]`); the payload travels separately, forced only
# inside a contribution's lazy fields. See REFERENCE.md.

  # mount happens in the families step; this is the pure binder the `adaptEnv` rider is applied through.

  # `then` = the config producer). The families-step consumer either LOWERS this record onto the
  # `__configThunk` path or RETIRES both into one — recorded here so no THIRD defer surface is built.
  # `then` is a Nix keyword, so the record's field is read dynamically (`record.${"then"}`) and surfaced as
  # the keyword-free `thenFn`. The EXECUTABLE check now: a `then` producing `options`/`imports` is ILLEGAL (a
