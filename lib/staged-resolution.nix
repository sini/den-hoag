# The STAGED ROOT-RESOLUTION pre-pass (design note 2026-07-11 §2/§3(ii) + §3c-UNIFIED) — the ONE
# mechanism that closes the S1-catalogued gaps under a single pass, now with TUPLE-CARRIED BINDINGS
# (`relate` DISSOLVED — one verb, `member`):
#
#   • CELL ROUTING (the codebase's deferred "Task 4"): a bare `member` emitted by a policy landed in the
#     structural group but was never routed into the fleet (`membershipTuples` was static `den.membership`
#     ONLY). A5's law already anticipates policy-emitted membership from membership-independent nodes —
#     this pass delivers it: a `member` with `containTo = null` (a CELL tuple) becomes a fleet tuple.
#   • CONTAINMENT TUPLES (was `relate`): env/host roots are independent parentless scope roots with NO
#     cross-node data path. A `member` with `containTo = <root-kind>` carries (a) ctx `bindings` the target
#     root's ctx folds — for SUBSEQUENT pre-pass phases AND the main run's inherited-context — AND (b) its
#     SOURCE coordinate as the target root's containment ANCESTOR (the env→host / env→cluster edge, fed to
#     the settings-chain env slice, resolved-settings.nix). It NEVER becomes a product cell — that is what
#     kills the cross-join (a sibling registry-backed root like `cluster` stays a root, never a cell).
#
# STRUCTURE (kind-generic, corpus-inert): a kind-ordered iteration over ROOT nodes, run BEFORE the fleet
# product builds (no attribute-schedule change — the pass is compositional and severable). The kind order
# is DERIVED from the discovered containment-kind topology (`meta.<k>.parent`, the schema `_topology`
# fact — NEVER a hardcoded kind list). Per phase (one root kind, parent-before-child): dispatch that
# kind's roots' resolve-family policies with ctx = node decls + relation bindings accumulated so far; a
# `containTo`-marked `member` folds its bindings + ancestor into the target root for later phases + the
# main run; a bare `member` becomes a cell tuple. Each phase is a MONOTONE pass over a node set fixed
# before it (A5).
#
# OPEN-ITEM RESOLUTIONS (verified against the codebase before build):
#   (a) PRE-PASS CTX = node decls (a root is parentless, so its `inherited-context` = its own decls, the
#       same `__`-key strip as attributes/structural.nix attr 1) + accumulated relation bindings. The
#       graph-level `enrichments` (attr 2) are NOT folded: computing them pre-fleet would either force
#       `structural.eval` (→ theFleet → membershipTuples → a cycle) or duplicate the attr-2 fixpoint, and
#       the corpus resolution chain (design §1) reads decls + relation-carried accessGroups only, never
#       den-hoag `enrich`-policy enrichments. Minimal and corpus-faithful.
#   (b) DOUBLE-FIRE DISCIPLINE: the resolve-family kind {member} is consumed by THIS pass ONLY; every
#       other kind by the main run — an exactly-one-consumer split. A resolve policy still fires in both
#       passes (a policy is `ctx: [decls]`), but at roots its `member` was consumed here and the main run's
#       structural consumers (attr 5/6) never read it; at a membership-DERIVED node a resolve-family
#       emission aborts LOUD (`errors.memberAtCell`, attributes/structural.nix attr 4), never a silent
#       drop. Resolve policies scope-restrict via the existing `__firesAtKinds` pre-filter.
#
# Pure gen-prelude + gen-dispatch wiring (Law A1): the ONLY loop is a `foldl'` over a pre-fixed phase list
# — NO `scope.circular`, NO `dispatchStep` (the fixpoint/step machinery stays in the two declared circular
# attributes). `declare`/`errors` are den-hoag vocabulary DEPs.
