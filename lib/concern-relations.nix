# den.relations — the declarative relation registry (spec §5), desugaring onto the LIVE `den.edges` edge-kind
# registry at the `resolution` stratum (§2.2 one-registry — no parallel graph). A relation
# `<name> = { inverse ? null; data ? {}; }` registers exactly ONE edge-kind `<name>` @resolution
# (closure = false), carrying `inverse` as LABEL-ONLY metadata (the reverse-query label, §2.2).
#
# NO second kind is registered for the inverse. den.query is source-agnostic — it string-compares a flat edge
# list and never consults the edge-kind table — so the inverse label is followable unregistered: the producer
# emits swapped `<inverse>`-labeled edges, and the per-entity accessor follows that label. The forward
# registration IS load-bearing, though: the one-registry is the source of truth the producer iterates to know
# which relations exist and their inverse labels. `closure = false` makes the registry closure-gate a no-op
# (the surface has no closure field); the closure CAPABILITY is a downstream (discipline-registering) concern.
