# The den-hoag-facing wiring (spec-vs-reality flag 1: den-hoag has `mkDen userModules`, not a
# `flakeModule`). Two pieces:
#
#   - `flakeModuleCore` — the module(s) that DECLARE the v1 option surface as `raw`, so the v1 grammar
#     rides untouched through a module eval. den-hoag's own `mkDen` declares `den.aspects`/`den.classes`/
#     `den.schema`/… with its OWN types, so the v1 surface cannot be read in the SAME eval (two typed
#     declarations at one path conflict). It is therefore read in a SEPARATE v1-shaped eval (`evalV1`),
#     whose config `compile` desugars — the "two-eval" shape the spec's "importing den-hoag's flakeModule
#     underneath" resolves to. `flakeModule = flakeModuleCore ++ [ legacy.* ]` is the severance surface.
#   - `mkFleetModule` — the PURE bridge: `compile`'s five-key output → ONE den-hoag module setting
#     `config.den.*`. No option is redeclared here (it EMITS den-hoag config), so no collision. This is
#     what `denHoag.mkDen` consumes.
#
# `mkDen` ties them: eval the v1 modules in the v1-shaped tree, compile, bridge, hand to `denHoag.mkDen`.
