  # ── DISPATCH-EMITTED content-set include (the census TWIN path — the revived arm). A v1 policy body
  # emits `policy.include den.aspects.<path>` where the navigated value crosses the raw bridge as a BARE
  # content set navigated off the typed `den` arg (so it carries its OWN native `.key`). Two corpus consumers:
  #   • `user-aspect-auto-include` (defaults.nix:14-22) emits `den.aspects.<host>.<user>` at user cells —
  #     the nested sub-aspects the translateAspect split strips (blade/cortex × sini/shuo);
  #   • `cluster-aspect` (policies/clusters.nix:73) emits `den.aspects.<cluster>` at cluster scopes
  #     (`den.aspects.axon`, clusters/axon.nix:101).
  # The emitted value is GROUNDED through the SAME normalizeList machinery translateAspect uses (class keys
  # grounded, `.includes` children wrapped/recursed — so the sub-aspect's firefox/steam/spicetify includes
  # resolve at the cell). IDENTITY: a navigated value carries its OWN native gen-aspects `.key` (v1 wrapChild
  # parity — normalize.nix:95-119), so `mkEmittedAspect` grounds it by that key — CELL-INDEPENDENT (identity is
  # the value's, not the cell's: two emitters at one cell can't collide, one set from two cells dedups to one
  # node per key-space). A closure-captured / SYNTHETIC value with NO `.key` falls back to the DETERMINISTIC
  # SCOPE-COORD identity: name = `<emitted>@<coord names>`, id_hash over the firing cell's entity-coord id_hashes
  # — stable across eval order, distinct per cell. At the value-less stratum probe the coords are sentinel
  # entries (which carry id_hash/name), so the fallback is probe-safe (both corpus emitters emit nothing there).
  # A `policy.include <value>` whose value is a CONTENT SET (not a `{ name }`/`{ id_hash }` reference to a
  # registered aspect): either a NAVIGATED node off the typed `den` arg (carries its OWN native `.key` — the
  # corpus `user-aspect-auto-include` emitting `den.aspects.<host>.<user>`) or a closure-captured / synthetic

  # as DATA instead — the general policy vocabulary for a generated policy that cannot shape its formals.)
  # The translation of each effect is eager only when the body runs (per ctx); compile itself never runs
  # it. A `for`/`when` policy record (`{ __isPolicy; fn }`) contributes its inner `fn`'s formals + effects

  # probe) has its stratum derived per-declaration there; this compile stays stratum-agnostic.

  # built-in route (os-to-host / user-to-host, legacy/batteries) declares `{ __denCanTake = <shape>; fn =
  # { <coords>, ... }: [ effects ]; }`. This wraps `fn` with the SHAPE's LITERAL formals — so den-hoag's
  # `dispatch.fromFunction` reads them as the canTake condition (the policy fires only where those
  # coordinates are in scope) AND concern-policies' stratum probe fills them with sentinel entries, so the
  # route's UNCONDITIONAL emission classifies as RESOLUTION. Nix cannot build a formal set from a runtime
  # list, so the shapes are a small fixed set — the two the corpus's built-in routes need.
  #
  # THE GENERAL PATTERN + HAZARD (not os-specific): concern-policies classifies a policy's stratum by
  # PROBING it at a VALUE-LESS sentinel context. So any policy whose emission is CONDITIONAL on a ctx VALUE
  # (not just coordinate PRESENCE) emits nothing at the probe → is misclassified as an enrich policy → and,
  # when it fires at a real scope and produces a resolution declaration (delivery/edge) in the enrich
  # stratum, CRASHES LOUDLY (`attribute 'key' missing` in the enrich delta). The fix for the built-in
  # routes is this path (emit UNCONDITIONALLY given the canTake coordinates, gate on PRESENCE only; a
  # value-absent target renders a `__dropped` no-op — translateDelivery). A CORPUS USER policy that emits
  # value-conditionally will hit the same misclassification — a C8 watch item: it aborts loudly by design

  # NAME-keyed at the walking scope (handlers/policy.nix:8-20 `scopedAspectPolicies.${name}`) and firing it
  # there gated on the fn's REQUIRED formals (`resolveArgsSatisfied`, synthesize-policies.nix:7-16;
  # per-name fire dedup, policy/dispatch.nix:54). The two grains above cover `den.schema.<kind>.includes`
  # and TOP-LEVEL `den.default.includes` records; a record NESTED in a regular aspect's `.includes`
  # (corpus: `den.aspects.sini.includes = [ den.batteries.host-aspects ]`, users/sini.nix:4 — the
  # battery's `includes = [ { __isPolicy; name = "host-aspects-project"; fn; } ]`, the compat battery
  # faithful to v1 batteries/host-aspects.nix) previously fell to `groundRec` and aborted §2.2 on `fn`
  # (ledger u15).
  #
  # THE WALK: a STATIC collection over the surfaces every arrival path re-reads — the `den.aspects`
  # registry trees (the translateAspect path AND the dispatch-emitted path, which re-reads the SAME
  # annotated tree off `_module.args.den`, ledger r). Per value:
  # its `.includes` list elements (a policy record collects; an attrset recurses — the battery nesting)
  # and its nested/namespace attrset children (the annotate-walk guard: non-`__`, non-structural,
  # non-class, non-quirk — `den.aspects.<host>.<user>` sub-aspects, `core.systemd` namespace nodes).
  # SEEN-set on element NAMES breaks reference cycles (a.includes=[b], b.includes=[a] — v1's own walk
  # dedups by identity.key the same way); the final per-NAME dedup mirrors v1's name-keyed registry (two
  # DISTINCT same-named records at different aspects would collapse — v1 registers both at their
  # respective scopes; corpus-one-record, a named ceiling). FORCING: attrset WHNF + includes list spines
  # of authored static data — the same grain annotate/translateAspect already force; never a fn call or
  # module body.
  #
  # THE RULES: each record compiles via the SAME `compilePolicy` as the sibling grains, named
  # `__aspectInclude__<name>` (the reserved `__` namespace — collision-free vs user policies, and
  # name-stable because the collection dedups by name). Gate = `compilePolicy`'s own
  # `__condition = functionArgs (innerFn record)` — v1's `resolveArgsSatisfied` REQUIRED-formals presence
  # gate verbatim (host-aspects-project's `{ host, user, ... }` fires at (user,host) cells) — AND
  # `__firesAtKinds` (board #57, below): the record's REQUIRED entity-kind formals, confining the arm to
  # OWNER-KIND nodes so a `{ host }` include no longer over-fires at a user cell that inherits its host's
  # `host` coord. The finer aspect-ATTACHMENT locality (v1 fires ONLY at scopes whose walk REGISTERED the
  # record — e.g. the including user's cell vs all cells) is v1's SECOND confinement, corpus-unexercised,

  #     bare fn NOR a policy record — e.g. an int) keeps `resolveAspectRef`'s named identity abort (R9).
  #   • a POLICY RECORD (`{ __isPolicy; fn }` — `mkPolicy`/`for`/`when`, or a coerced `den.policies` reference;
  #     `{ __denCanTake }` built-in route) → its own `__kindInclude__<kind>__policy__<i>` RECORD via
  #     `compilePolicy`, with the KIND coord UNIONED into its declared gate so it fires at the kind's nodes
  #     even if the fn does not destructure the kind entity. A value-conditional record (env-to-clusters'
  #     cluster-match) emits nothing at the value-less probe → concern-policies derives its stratum per
  #     declaration (no misclassification).
  #   • a BARE FUNCTION → a PARAMETRIC ASPECT (R14 correction; v1 `wrapBareFn` normalize.nix:62-82, NOT a
  #     policy). It wraps through the EXISTING `normalizeList`/`wrapFn`/`callGated` machinery and registers as
  #     a SYNTHETIC ASPECT (`__kindInclude__<kind>__aspect__<i>`, a positional identity — the collision-fix
  #     naming) which the SAME `__kindInclude__<kind>` edge policy then edges. `forwardExpand` invokes the
  #     wrapped fn with the real node ctx (`callGated` gates on coord presence + arg-shapes); its RESULT is
  #     type-dispatched (`callGated`, per v1 `mkParametricNext`): an ATTRSET is aspect CONTENT (agenix's
  #     per-class `${host.class}`), a LIST re-resolves via `grndDispatch`'s §5.1 include-effect branch (the
  #     v1 `mkParametricNext` list arm — each include effect's `.value`, flattened). This routes a content-returning
  #     bare-fn kind-include (agenix's `agenixHostAspect`) as CONTENT, never through `compilePolicy` (whose
  #     `concatMap` on effects would choke on it) — the agenix rung.

  # DUPLICATE content (v1 dedups by provider name; the shim cannot mechanically guard — content-set equality

  #     the parent (mkIsNestedAspectKey) and the include arm re-wraps the emitted value with the
  #     deterministic cell identity (`<emitted>@blade.shuo` ≠ `<emitted>@cortex.shuo`).

  # policy/default.nix:82-113 `installPolicies` "Policies fire where they're registered — scope-local only";
  # subtree fan-out filtered by `requiredEntityArgs`, schema.nix:157-199). A `den.policies.<name>` is a NAMED
  # DEFINITION; presence alone fires NOWHERE — it must be INCLUDED to function. So a policy NAME referenced
  # from an include is REMOVED from the fleet-wide compiled set (`includeReferencedNames`); its firing rides
  # its `__kindInclude__<kind>__policy__<i>` arm ALONE, which `__firesAtKinds`
  # confines to owner-kind nodes (Part 2). INVARIANT: an include-referenced policy fires via EXACTLY its
  # include arms. The removal set covers every arm-creating path — `expandRefs` (which hoists inline-aspect
  # `.includes`) over every kind's raw includes, plus the aspect-include records
  # (`aspectIncludeRecords`, the #65 regular-aspect grain — a `den.policies` record nested in a regular
  # aspect's `.includes` fires via its `__aspectInclude__<name>` arm alone, corpus-zero) — via the SAME
  # `isPolicyRef` filter each arm builder uses, so the arm set and the removal set coincide. A policy `.name` is its
  # `den.policies` KEY (the bridge coercion, policy-type.nix); a reference-only inline record (no
  # `den.policies.<name>`) yields a name `removeAttrs` no-ops on. The SHIM-SYNTHETIC `user-to-host` global
