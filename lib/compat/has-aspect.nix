# THE PROJECTED hasAspect ENTITY SURFACE (v1 PR #602 semantics; the den-hoag dissolution).
#
# v1 stamps a SHARED projected `hasAspect` onto every entity-kind ctx binding at the CONSUMING scope
# (pin sg0zid…-source nix/lib/aspects/fx/policy/schema.nix:88-96 — one `mkProjectedHasAspect` answers for
# the active scope's re-keyed bucket, so `host`/`user`/… all read "is X delivered into THIS scope"). The
# membership test is `refKey ref ∈ pathSet`; under A-IDENT (Task 3) `refKey` is a SINGLE native-`.key`
# lookup + a NAMED throw for a keyless ref (never a silent false). The surface is class-invariant
# (`{ __functor; forClass; forAnyClass; }`).
#
# THE DISSOLUTION (v2). den-hoag has NO re-key machinery and no per-scope path-set bucket: a node's
# resolved-aspects (attribute 7) IS the projected set for that node — the deduped `[ { key; content; } ]`
# list whose keys are exactly `gen-aspects.key` of every aspect delivered into the node. So the projected
# hasAspect is a pure lookup over the node's OWN resolved-aspects entry keys, keyed by `refKey` — the same
# `gen-aspects.key` identity, so the ref and the resolved node agree BY CONSTRUCTION (W2 pins it).
#
# THE MATCHING LAW (native identity). `refKey ref` = `ref.key`: under A-IDENT every `den.aspects.<path>`
# value carries its OWN container-relative `.key` (born in gen-aspects' type). A NAVIGATED value off the `den`
# arg (the shim binds the NAVIGATION view — flake-module.nix `bindLegacyEnv → annotatedViewNav`) AND a value
# read straight off the compiled REGISTRY both carry `.key`, and it equals the resolved node's key
# (`resolved-aspects.nix` `keyOf concrete`, the SAME `gen-aspects.key`). It is a single lookup — no
# reconstruction (native identity is the only identity).
#
# THE CENSUS (nix-config b0b20769): 13 reads, all `host.hasAspect den.aspects.<path>`, all in
# delivery-depth nixos aspect bodies (networking.nix:341 `core.network.manager`, gpg.nix:80/bitwarden.nix:39
# `roles.*`, steam.nix:13 / hardware/*, disk/impermanence guards), all HARD (an `attribute 'hasAspect'
# missing` at the binding if absent). The corpus reads only `host.hasAspect`; the surface stamps EVERY
# entity-kind binding (v1-faithful) so `user`/`cluster` reads resolve too.
#
# LAZINESS (A17 — load-bearing). `refKey`, `seen`, and the projected closures are built INSIDE `mkHas`'s
# body: forcing the enriched bindings (the terminal binding spine, even under deepSeq) only forces the
# stamped attrsets to lambdas — it NEVER forces `resolvedAspects`. Only CALLING a `hasAspect` closure forces
# `seen` (hence resolved-aspects). So the entity-stamp never re-enters the resolve that produced it (W4).
