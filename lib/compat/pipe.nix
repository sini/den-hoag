# den-compat pipe vocabulary compilation (§2.4, Law C2 — pure). Two surfaces:
#
#   1. `den.quirks.<name>` → a den-hoag channel registration `{ channel; ops; adapters; }` (`channelOf`):
#      the v1 quirk's gen-pipe channel options ride into `channel`; concern-quirks turns the record into
#      the ONE fleet gen-pipe channel. A den v1 quirk is mostly a `{ description = …; }` marker, so the
#      default is an ordered-list channel; a quirk carrying merge/dedup/type/… channel options passes them
#      through (its non-channel keys — `description`, … — are dropped: `pipe.channel` rejects unknown keys).
#
#   2. the v1 `pipe.from name [stages]` policy effect → a den-hoag collection-stratum `pipeOp` declaration
#      (`compilePipe`): the deriving stages (filter/transform/fold/for) fold LEFT-TO-RIGHT into a gen-pipe
#      operator DAG rooted at the named channel (`stageOp`); the delivery (to/as) and site (append/expose/
#      broadcast/collect/collectAll/withProvenance) stages ride as inert markers the emission/consumption
#      site interprets. NOTHING is forced (Law C2, NO EFFECT RUNTIME): the op DAG is BUILT from the stage
#      closures without ever APPLYING them.
#
# DEFERRED-VALUE DISCIPLINE (parity-watch items 5, 6). A config-demanding channel value (`{ config, … }:
# …` / `{ osConfig, … }: …`) is den-hoag's deferred contribution (`attributes/collections.nix`
# `isConfigThunk`): it rides the channel RAW and is resolved ONLY at the terminal, where `deferredToThunk`
# hands it to gen-bind's `__configThunk` (resolve-at-producing-scope, decision #27). The compat obligation
# is (5) to leave that value a bare config-demanding FUNCTION so gen-bind keeps the consuming class
# module's config arg UNBOUND (gen-bind `wrap.nix` `allMatched` — a fully-bound consumer would skip thunk
# resolution) and (6) to never compile a v1 pipe into an operator that FORCES the value mid-fold (a
# value-demanding fold/scan over a deferred value is gen-pipe E6 poison). Both fall out of pure desugar:
# `compile.nix` `translateAspect` passes a quirk-key value through untouched, and `compilePipe` builds
# inert op records here — the deferred marker crosses the compiled v1 pipe intact.
