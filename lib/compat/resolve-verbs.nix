# den.lib.aspects.{resolve,resolveWithPaths,resolveImports} + den.lib.resolveEntity — a CONFIG-WIRED ADAPTER
# over den-hoag's ALREADY-NATIVE resolution output. v1 (den nix/lib/aspects/default.nix:
# 104-114, pin a2f4b60) ran a FRESH isolated fx pipeline per seed; den-hoag instead reads the memoized
# gen-edge fold over the ALREADY-INGESTED fleet graph (`built.den`), so this adapter closes over that built
# den and maps a seed → the node id its `output.outputFor`/`traceFor` key by. The field-map is
# THEORY-DETERMINED and oracle-proven the v1 twin (lib/compat/parity/oracle.nix:334-360,439-458,497 diffs
# `hoag traceFor == v1 edgeTrace` and `outputFor.<id>.<class> == v1 resolveWithPaths…imports`).
#
# CONFIG-WIRED (not the config-less migrationLib): it needs the built fleet, so it is bound at the bridge
# seam (bridge.nix `configWiredLib`) exactly as the bridge seam binds `nh`/`schemaUtil`/`policyInspect`. The
# migrationLib carries NAMED config-wired stubs (throw on `inputs.den.lib`, real on the `den` module arg).
#
# ── LATENT ceilings (off-fleet arbitrary-tree resolve — deferred; needs per-call mini-ingest) ──────────
#  (a) ARBITRARY-NON-FLEET-ENTITY aspect tree. v1 `resolve`/`resolveImports` run over ANY seed (the
#      "extract homeManager modules from a host tree" nested-extraction, default.nix:113 doc). This adapter
#      resolves only a seed that maps to an INGESTED node (a built-fleet member); an off-fleet arbitrary
#      aspect tree would need a per-call mini-ingest (deferred). LATENT until a nix-config corpus
#      policy is shown to call resolve on a non-fleet tree.
#  (b) SELF-REFERENCE. This adapter closes over `built.den`, which is the fold over the whole fleet; a
#      future corpus policy that calls `resolve <ownHost>` from WITHIN its own fleet self-references
#      (forcing `built.den` re-enters resolution). The config-wired adapter is STATEFUL by construction, so
#      such a call is a latent cycle — no live consumer today (surface-totality; the witness resolves an
#      external fixture, never a self-call). LATENT.
#
# `resolveWithState` (v1 default.nix:114 → the raw `{ value; state; }` fx-trampoline result) has NO den-hoag
# native twin (fx retired) — it stays a NAMED stub on the migrationLib, never wired here.

  # is an fx primitive den-hoag retired, and native resolution reads ctx from the ingested node's
  # enriched-context (resolved-aspects.nix), never a seed field. The handle is the node id — a readable coord
  # path `"${kind}:${name}"` (lib/default.nix:1092, output-modules.nix:883), the key `outputFor`/`traceFor`
