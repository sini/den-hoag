# The OUTPUT BRIDGE (ship-gate M1) — den-hoag's flake-parts-side assembly: the single splice mechanism
# that mounts the shim's evaluated fleet at flake-parts option targets (D8). It is what a consumer's
# `imports = [ inputs.den.flakeModule ]` merges into its STRICT flake-parts eval, replacing the bare
# option-declaring export: it DECLARES `options.den`, reads back `config.den`, runs the compat assembly,
# and SETS `config.flake.nixosConfigurations` / `darwinConfigurations` — the drop-in `den` output face.
#
# TWO-EVAL BRIDGE (the C1 boundary at the flake-parts seam; resolves the gen-schema↔nixpkgs type crossing):
# the consumer eval is nixpkgs flake-parts (strict), which CANNOT process gen-schema option types
# (`substSubModules` is a nixpkgs-only method). So the flake-parts-side `options.den` is declared with the
# consumer's NIXPKGS `lib` (the injected module arg — this bridge is the SECOND sanctioned nixpkgs touch,
# after the terminal; it IMPORTS no nixpkgs, lib/** import-purity intact) as a freeform SUBMODULE
# (`freeformType = anything`): den's rich v1 grammar rides through as inert data, DEEP-MERGED across the
# corpus's many `den.*` modules exactly as v1's typed option did (respecting `mkDefault`/`mkForce`), while
# the submodule form remains a legal parent for the `options.den.<x>` sub-options a consumer declares. The
# shim then runs its OWN gen-schema `evalModuleTree` INTERNALLY (`mkDenWith` → `evalV1`) on the single,
# pre-merged `config.den` def — so gen-schema types never enter the consumer's evalModules.
#
# INSTANTIATION (D7): a fleet's per-host nixpkgs crossing is a DECLARED instantiation — the corpus sets
# `host.instantiate = <channel>.nixosSystem` (nix-config schema/host.nix). Honoring that declared per-host
# evaluator is ship-gate M2; THIS milestone (M1) wires the mechanics on the global-fallback grain: when
# `den.nixpkgs` is supplied it crosses ALL nixos members through one `crossNixos` (real NixOS systems),
# else the nixpkgs-free `collect` terminal (the member keys are present — a non-empty `nixosConfigurations`
# — with inspectable module artifacts, not built systems). `den.darwin` is the symmetric fallback; the
# per-host darwin crossing is also M2. `mkDen`/`mkDenWith`/`evalV1` are UNTOUCHED (Law preservation): the
# bridge is flake-parts-side assembly only, so the parity harness (which drives `mkDen` directly) and
# den-hoag's own mkDen-direct paths stay byte-identical.
#
# `mkCrossNixos nixpkgs` — the `crossNixos` builder closure (flake.nix threads `lib.internal.{bind,flake}`
# + the terminal source); called with the consumer-supplied `den.nixpkgs` at fold time.
