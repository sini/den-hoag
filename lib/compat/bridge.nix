# The OUTPUT BRIDGE (ship-gate M1) — den-hoag's flake-parts-side assembly: the single splice mechanism
# that mounts the shim's evaluated fleet at flake-parts option targets (D8). It is what a consumer's
# `imports = [ inputs.den.flakeModule ]` merges into its STRICT flake-parts eval, replacing the bare
# option-declaring export: it DECLARES `options.den`, reads back `config.den`, runs the compat assembly,
# and SETS `config.flake.nixosConfigurations` / `darwinConfigurations` — the drop-in `den` output face.
#
# TWO-EVAL BRIDGE (the C1 boundary at the flake-parts seam; resolves the gen-schema↔nixpkgs type crossing):
# the consumer eval is nixpkgs flake-parts (strict), which CANNOT process gen-schema option types
# (`substSubModules` is a nixpkgs-only method). So the flake-parts-side `options.den` is declared with the
# consumer's NIXPKGS `lib` (the injected module arg — this bridge is the SECOND sanctioned nixpkgs touch,
# after the terminal; it IMPORTS no nixpkgs, lib/** import-purity intact) as a freeform SUBMODULE
# (`freeformType = anything`): den's rich v1 grammar rides through as inert data, DEEP-MERGED across the
# corpus's many `den.*` modules exactly as v1's typed option did (respecting `mkDefault`/`mkForce`), while
# the submodule form remains a legal parent for the `options.den.<x>` sub-options a consumer declares. The
# shim then runs its OWN gen-schema `evalModuleTree` INTERNALLY (`mkDenWith` → `evalV1`) on the single,
# pre-merged `config.den` def — so gen-schema types never enter the consumer's evalModules.
#
# INSTANTIATION (D7): a fleet's per-host nixpkgs crossing is a DECLARED instantiation — the corpus sets
# `host.instantiate = <channel>.nixosSystem` (nix-config schema/host.nix:325, a SCHEMA-DECLARED default,
# not an authored per-host field). Ship-gate M2 honors it in TWO halves: the compat nixos wrapper
# (flake-module.nix mkNixosInstantiate) crosses a host through its own evaluator when `instantiateFor`
# yields one, and the bridge's per-host SCHEMA-TYPED INSTANCE EVAL (fork (i), `hostHarvest` below)
# MATERIALIZES the schema default so `instantiateFor` sees it at all — v1 materialized it by evaluating
# each host through the kind's instance submodule (pin 11866c16 nix/lib/entities/host.nix:53-57); raw
# authored decls alone never carry it. The M1 global-fallback grain remains underneath: when
# `den.nixpkgs` is supplied, instantiate-less nixos members cross through one `crossNixos` (real NixOS
# systems), else the nixpkgs-free `collect` terminal (the member keys are present — a non-empty
# `nixosConfigurations` — with inspectable module artifacts, not built systems). `den.darwin` is the
# symmetric fallback; the per-host darwin crossing is the class-B arm (the wrapper is nixos-stamped
# only). `mkDen`/`mkDenWith`/`evalV1` are UNTOUCHED (Law preservation): the bridge is flake-parts-side
# assembly only, so the parity harness (which drives `mkDen` directly) and den-hoag's own mkDen-direct
# paths stay byte-identical (no bridge ⇒ no harvest ⇒ `instantiateFor` reads authored fields alone).

  # No gen-schema type enters the consumer's strict eval; the shim re-validates internally (compile's
  # surface-totality gate), so this boundary submodule stays deliberately freeform.
  #
  # SCHEMA PROCESSING (ship-gate M1.75). `den.schema` is the ONE exception to raw absorption: v1's
  # `options.den.schema` is a gen-schema `mkSchemaOption` that PROCESSES raw kind declarations
  # (`den.schema.<K> = { parent; options; isEntity; … }`) into gen-schema KIND-VALUES carrying
  # `{ kind; strict; refs; options; validators; refinements }`. A corpus module reads that processed value
  # at declaration time (`options.den.clusters = mkInstanceRegistry den.schema.cluster`) — so the bridge
  # MUST reproduce the processing, else the corpus's own mkInstanceRegistry throws `attribute 'refs' missing`.
  # We do it as an `apply` (definitions→value transform): the raw declarations arrive as the sub-option's
  # DEFINITIONS; the apply runs the shim's OWN gen-schema (`schema.evalModuleTree` + `mkSchemaOption`) in a
  # NESTED eval — gen-schema types stay INSIDE that eval, never mounted into the consumer's nixpkgs
  # evalModules (the type-crossing dodge, same as the top-level freeform) — and returns the processed
  # kind-values as `config.den.schema`. apply reads the merged DEFINITIONS, never the applied value, so no
  # fixpoint. CROSS-PIN: the corpus's registries READ the kind-value with the corpus's gen-schema; we
  # PRODUCE it with ours — both must agree on the contract field set (a shape mismatch throws NAMED, never
  # silent). This mirrors v1's own read-behavior (v1 den.schema is equally a processing option).

      # policy-type.nix:15-24, pin 11866c16), reproduced at the bridge boundary. It does TWO jobs at once:
      #
      #  (1) FORMAL-PRESERVATION (why it lives here, not in the freeform `anything`). A v1 policy
      #      `den.policies.<name> = { host, environment, ... }: [ effects ]` is a TOP-LEVEL FUNCTION value.
      #      nixpkgs `lib.types.anything.merge` WRAPS a top-level fn value in a bare `arg:` lambda (its
      #      fn-merge branch), ERASING its `functionArgs` — so through the freeform `anything` a policy fn's
      #      declared coords (`{ cluster, environment }`) become `{ }`, compile reads `__condition = { }`, and
      #      concern-policies' value-less probe applies the fn WITHOUT a required coord (an UNCATCHABLE throw).
      #      This type bypasses `anything` and — by NESTING the fn inside a `{ __isPolicy; fn }` record — keeps
      #      its formals intact (a NESTED fn is NOT erased; the top-level-vs-nested blast-radius survey). It
      #      therefore SUBSUMES the old `denPoliciesDefs` raw-def collector: nesting preserves what the raw
      #      read did, and the coercion additionally restores the discriminator below.
      #
      #  (2) THE v1 DISCRIMINATOR (what unblocks the agenix rung). v1 tells a POLICY from a PARAMETRIC ASPECT
      #      by SHAPE: a `{ __isPolicy }` record is a policy (children.nix `isPolicy → register-aspect-policy`);
      #      a bare FUNCTION is a parametric aspect (normalize.nix `wrapBareFn`). `den.policies.<name>` VALUES
      #      are coerced to `{ __isPolicy; name; fn }` records HERE (policy-type.nix) — so a `den.policies.X`
      #      REFERENCE in a `den.schema.<kind>.includes` list arrives as a RECORD (→ compile classifies it a
      #      policy), while a LOCAL bare-fn aspect (agenix's `agenixHostAspect`, never laundered through
      #      `den.policies`) stays a bare fn (→ compile classifies it a parametric aspect). Without the
      #      coercion both arrive as bare fns and the shim cannot tell them apart (it mis-labelled the local
      #      aspect a policy → `compilePolicy`'s `concatMap` on aspect CONTENT). R14 correction.
      #
      # MERGE CEILING (out-of-corpus, Fork-A precedent): the shallow per-module `//` union is definition-order
      # (later wins per name); the corpus's policy names are distinct across modules, so it reproduces the
      # same effective set. A `{ __denCanTake }` built-in route (`user-to-host`) and any non-fn value ride
      # through UNCHANGED (compile reads the `__denCanTake` SHAPE, not fn formals) — only a bare fn is wrapped
      # and a `{ __isPolicy }` record is name-stamped, both harmless to the standalone compile (its `innerFn`
      # already unwraps `{ __isPolicy }` identically to a bare fn).

      # therefore rides `den.default.includes` PRE-MANGLED. Downstream compile.nix `normalizeList`/`callGated`
      # (§339, v1 `can-take.nix` required-coord parity) DOES wrap it, but reads that ERASED `functionArgs`, so
      # its gate sees `required = [ ]` and fires the wrapper UNCONDITIONALLY — at a HOST scope (ctx has `host`,
      # no `user`) the wrapper re-applies `userToHostContext { }` → the UNCATCHABLE `called without required
      # argument 'user'`. (Record batteries survived: `anything`'s LIST branch does not recurse elements, so
      # define-user's nested include fns keep their formals and `callGated` gates them correctly — only the
      # TOP-LEVEL bare-fn shape was mangled.) This is the SAME top-level-fn-erasure hazard `options.policies`
      # documents; the batteries arm simply never had a declared option, and only surfaced once 8cf3f31 unblocked
      # the `den.default` cross-module fold so the primary-user element could radiate to a host scope at all.
      #
      # A battery value is coerced NOWHERE — it must ride BYTE-IDENTICAL (a bare fn stays a bare fn so
      # `callGated` reads its REAL formals; a record/functor stays itself), so this is a plain raw-preserving
      # UNION (shallow `//`, later-def-wins per battery name — the corpus has a single `den.batteries` def),
      # NOT the `policies` coercion nor the `default` deep-merge. The KEY stays inert-by-reference (no concern
      # reads `den.batteries`; a referenced battery rides the include list), so compile's surface-totality
      # already accepts it (knownSurfaceKeys `"batteries"`).

      # whose per-class-key content wrapper holds every fn value RAW (`aspectContentType` stores defs
      # unmerged in `__contentValues`, types.nix:421 — a fn NEVER passes through a fn-merge). The freeform
      # `anything` above instead sends a fn at ANY attrset depth through its lambda-merge branch (nixpkgs
      # lib/types.nix:353-359), wrapping it in a bare `arg:` lambda — ERASING `functionArgs` — so EVERY
      # corpus aspect class fn crossed formals-erased, gen-bind's formals-driven wrapAll bound nothing, and
      # the corpus drvPath threw `function 'nixos' called without required argument 'firewall'` (corpus
      # modules/den/aspects/core/network/firewall-collector.nix:3) inside the real nixosSystem.
      #
      # THE LOAD-BEARING MECHANISM (why this fold fixes it): deepMerge recurses ONLY on collision (both
      # sides attrset at a shared key). A single-def subtree rides `bv` RAW, UNRECURSED. `anything` ALWAYS
      # recurses per-key (even single-def), which is what wraps a single-def leaf lambda into `arg:…`
      # (formals erased). So firewall-collector's single-path `nixos` fn rides `bv` RAW under deepMerge →
      # formals intact. Same v1 deep-merge shape as `options.default` (v1 types.nix:478-490, the shared
      # `v1DeepMerge`): colliding attrsets recurse (the namespace ancestors — `core`/`apps`/`services`/… —
      # union across the corpus's one-aspect-per-file modules), colliding lists concat (`includes`, v1's
      # listOf semantics), scalars last-def-wins. The shim re-derives `provides`/`_`/`__functor` + identity
      # via translateAspect (compile.nix); no shim consumer reads v1's `__contentValues`/`__provider`
      # typing off the bridge (compile.nix documents both as absent at the raw boundary).
      #
      # CEILING (fork A, corpus-zero): a fn-vs-fn collision at ONE class key is LAST-DEF-WINS here, where
      # v1 COLLECTS BOTH defs (`__contentValues`, types.nix:421) for emit-classes. The corpus has exactly
      # ONE cross-module aspect path (`core.impermanence` — impermanence.nix + darwin.nix, DISJOINT keys),
      # so no corpus def is dropped; adopt collect-both only when a real 2-module same-key class def
      # appears (`ci/tests/compat-bridge.nix` test-aspects-fnfn-collision-lastwins-ceiling pins the
      # semantics so any change announces). Fork C (corpus-zero): a TOP-LEVEL bare-fn aspect now reaches
      # translateAspect's fn-branch coercion (compile.nix) with PRESERVED formals, so compile's callGated
      # gates it correctly — a free correctness improvement over the erased-formals ride. Fork D CEILING
      # shared with `options.default` (see its comment): mkOption-bearing `settings` subtrees, corpus-zero
