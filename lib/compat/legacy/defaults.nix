# den-compat LEGACY surface: `defaults` (R4 + the built-in battery membership, spec §10).
#
# R4 — `den.default` RADIATION + BUILT-IN MEMBERSHIP. den v1 `modules/aspects/defaults.nix` radiates the
# `den.default` aspect as a schema include to EXACTLY kinds `{ host, user, home }` (`lib.genAttrs [ "host"
# "user" "home" ]` — this replaced the `*-to-default` policies). The RADIATION itself is already compiled
# by the shim core (compile.nix `defaultAspects`/`defaultPolicy`: `den.default` → the reserved `__default`
# aspect + a `__denDefault` policy destructuring `{ host, ... }`, whose canTake guard fires at host + user
# cells and never at a custom-kind scope — the three-kind narrowing, compat-surface.nix).
#
# This module carries the OTHER half R4 names: the BUILT-IN MEMBERSHIP — the batteries that v1 self-appends
# to `den.default.includes` (`os-to-host`, `user-to-host`, and the always-included predicate builders).
# It composes the corpus-exercised battery ports (`legacy/batteries/*`) into ONE pure v1 → v1 desugar,
# each adding its class bucket (R2) + built-in policy (R3/R6). PINNED, not widened: only the batteries the
# corpus exercises are ported (os-class R3, os-user R6); the rest (hjem, maid, tty-autologin, wsl, …) get
# explicit ledger rows — no hallucinated content (the C6 `canTake` finding stands; spec §10 R6).
#
# SEVERABLE (Law C5): applied by flake-module.nix `desugarLegacy` when in the wiring's legacy set. Severed
# ⇒ the identity; an aspect using a battery class (`os`/`user`) then aborts as an unknown key (R9).
