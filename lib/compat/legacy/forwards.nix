# den-compat LEGACY surface: `forwards` (self-contained, tagged — the severance surface, §2.1).
#
# The v1 forward system as a self-contained tagged module. A forward is `deliver from a class INTO
# another class[.path]`, split by v1 into two tiers (frozen pin denful/den@11866c16):
#
#   TIER-1 (static) — a directly-importable forward: static `intoClass`, static `intoPath`, no adapter
#     machinery (compile-forward.nix `isSimpleSpec = canDirectImport ∧ ¬needsAdapter ∧ ¬evalConfig`).
#     Desugars to a plain `deliver` (a collected source → reroute-shaped edge), IDENTICAL to v1's own
#     tier-1 classification — the shim just calls the public `deliver` surface (Task 2), the same path
#     the corpus takes, so severing this module never touches `deliver`.
#
#   COMPLEX (adapter-bearing) — a forward that threads args/modules through an adapter (`adaptArgs`,
#     `adapterModule`, a function-valued `intoPath`, a `mapModule`, `evalConfig`, or a `guard`; v1
#     forward.nix `needsAdapter`). Desugars to an INERT gen-edge `synthesize` SOURCE RECORD (Law C2's
#     ONE relaxation — the shim CONSTRUCTS the record, it never evaluates it, reads the scope graph, or
#     reads resolved state). Its identity triple is `(forwardId, fromClass, intoClass)`, matching the
#     frozen v1 schema (gen-edge core.nix `sourceKey`: `synthesize:${forwardId}/${fromClass}>${intoClass}`).
#     The record is INERT: gen-edge's `trace` renders only that identity and never forces the carried
#     module — so the edge "records identity, never resolved content" (v1's `sourceVia = "unresolved"`
#     edge annotation is the same property, added when the synthesize edge is assembled). The adapter
#     composition itself is this module's `interpret.synthesize`, which den-hoag RUNS later, inside its
#     single `materialize` fold, threaded via the shipped `den.interpret` raw seam (item 7).
#
# den-hoag constructs NO synthesize record and defines NO interpreter (item 7): both are the legacy
# module's, threaded in as data + a closure. With this module absent, any use of `den.classes.<c>.forwardTo`
# is a definition-time error (Law C5, sentinels.nix). (Tier-2 derived-children NTA: NOT implemented —
# the corpus census found zero consumers; PIN.md §Open-Question-2.)
