# The claim-accessor — the REVERSE-READ resolution equation over the off-trace claim pool (spec §5,
# productions substrate). Where the leaf claims (`emit = edges` CONSTANT productions, from = ∅) supply the
# FORWARD adjacency (a source reads its egress, who-do-I-claim), this equation delivers its TRANSPOSE (a
# target reads its ingress, who-claims-me) — the §9 algebraic-graph transpose (Mokhov 2017 §4.3), NOT a
# hand-rolled from/to swap. It is the sibling of `rel-accessor`: a `resolve.attr` at the `resolution` stratum
# with `readsAttrs = [ ]` (the claim pool is the STATIC, registry-derived `relationEdges` — GAP-5, so the
# compute ignores `self`). A later provider reads THIS accessor at its OWN node — an INTRA-stratum positive
# read (A9, Apt–Blair–Walker), the same posture `derived-accessor` reads `rel-accessor`.
#
# The per-node value is a handle with the node.query / node.rel silent-vs-throwing contract (§2.3 capability
# scope, concern-derived.nix):
#   `.query <kind>` (SILENT): the reverse claimers of `<kind>` — a missing OR out-of-scope claim kind yields
#                             `[ ]` (the exploratory-query mode: out-of-capability reach is naturally empty).
#   `.rel.<kind>`   (THROWING): the reverse claimers of `<kind>` — an out-of-scope claim kind is REPLACED
#                             with a NAMED throw (the capability-by-construction gate; a negation over this
#                             throwing read cannot mistake absent for out-of-scope).
# The capability boundary is the accessor's OWN stratum (`resolution`): a claim kind sits IN SCOPE when its
# stratum is STRICTLY BELOW `resolution` (the shipped connect < secret < database < route claim strata all
# qualify); a claim declared AT/above `resolution` is out of scope. Both variants share ONE `edgesBelowStratum`
# ceiling (the query SOURCE side of the boundary — scoping the claim pool scopes the capability).
#
# Corpus-inert: an empty `claimKinds` ⇒ `.query` is constantly `[ ]` and `.rel` is `{ }` for every node, and
# nothing outside a claim/provide fleet reads `claim-accessor`, so it never reaches the trace — byte-identical
# to the pre-claim output (the `rel-accessor` corpus-inert argument, applied to the reverse read).
