# Output stratum — HOAG attribute 12 (spec §2.10, Law A15). Two products over the SAME resolve eval:
#
#   (1) The gen-edge output fold. A graph accessor projects the resolve result into gen-edge's §2.3
#       contract (nodes/childrenOf/parentOf/isolatedAt/channelsOf/edgesAt/nameOf/contentsOf), and
#       `outputFor root = materialize { edges = toposort (edgesFor { graph, root }); projection =
#       project { graph, root, dials }; interpret; }` — THE toposorted fold, the only content path
#       (A15). `contentsOf` adapts gen-pipe channel contributions to gen-edge seeds (§2.10:
#       value→content, dedup identity→key, producer→provenance). `interpret` is a PARAMETER (default
#       `{ }`): native den-hoag constructs no `synthesize`/`rewalk` source, so it never supplies one;
#       an external consumer threads its rewalk/synthesize interpreters in through `den.interpret` (mkDen), so the
#       external source-interpreter seam is a real parameter here, not a source edit to this file.
#
#   (2) The per-class terminal crossing. `systems.<class>.<member>` instantiates each member (a scope
#       node whose producing class is that class, carrying non-empty `class-modules` content) via the
#       class's terminal (`classCfg.instantiate`). The output map is class-major and content-driven
#       (gen-flake `realize` shape): its SPINE is the member keys, so forcing it counts instantiations
#       without forcing an artifact (one instantiate per member, per-cell lazy — Law A17).
#
# Deferred channel contributions (config-thunks, PR #623) ride the fold's seed content UNFORCED and,
# for the terminal, are adapted to gen-bind `__configThunk` markers (`deferredToThunk`) so the terminal
# resolves them against the PRODUCING class+scope's config — the gen-merge/gen-flake terminal forces
# them there (resolve-at-producing-scope, decision #27).
#
# DEMAND EDGES (A11 — the A9 staging closed here): `demandEdges` is the fleet's gen-demand resolution
# rendered as inert gen-edge records (lib/demand.nix `toEdges`) — provider edges to output-arm sinks
# (`demands.<kind>.<key>`) and consumer edges to the subject's `wiring` root. They are FLEET-GLOBAL (one
# resolveAll per fleet, not per scope subtree), so `edgesFor`'s per-root subtree walk cannot gather them:
# the provider edges target output ARMS (which `edgesFor` filters out entirely, it keeps only root
# targets), and the consumer edges target a subject-identity root outside any single subtree. They are
# therefore CONCATENATED onto the per-root edge set before the one toposorted fold — `edgesFor {…} ++
# demandEdges` — so both join the fleet edge set (the trace) and materialize into config(root): providers
# under `config.outputs.demands.*`, consumers under `config.<subjectHash>.wiring`. Empty for a demand-free
# fleet ⇒ byte-identical to the pre-A11 fold (the append is `++ [ ]`).
#
# NO EFFECT RUNTIME: every body is field renames + attrset assembly + exactly one gen-edge call per
# algorithm (edgesFor/toposort/project/materialize) — Law A1. Deps: prelude, edge (the fold),
# bind (the config-thunk adaptation), classShare (the A10 gen-class tier-2 build path).

  # gen-edge is class-coordinate-generic (its README: "den's NixOS class buckets … are ONE instantiation")
  # — a class bucket IS a fold channel. den-hoag's attribute 9 (`class-modules`) computes, per node, the
  # `{ <class> = [ deferredModule ]; }` map; here it joins the graph accessor's channel view so class
  # content folds through the SAME gen-edge pipeline as quirk channels: a scope emits one
  # `collected:scope/<class> | merge` default-fold edge for its PRODUCING class (matching v1's
  # `defaultFoldEdges` by construction, edges/default.nix Corollary 1), and a `deliver`/`route`/`provide`
  # whose collected source names a CLASS moves that class's real content (before this, a class-source
  # delivery traced but its collected read hit an absent channel ⇒ empty — the C7.5 gap).
  #
  # PRODUCING-CLASS scoping (§2.5, mirrors the terminal): `class-modules` over-reports — the aspect
  # submodule's freeform gives EVERY class key a trivial `{ imports = [ ]; }` body even for an aspect that
  # declares no content there, so a bare-channel aspect at a nixos host shows non-empty nixos/home-manager/
  # k8s-manifests buckets alike. The terminal's `contentIdsOf` already resolves this by keying on the

  # scope — den-hoag's contentClass model), so a nixos host folds `nixos` (never a phantom k8s edge) and a
  # home-manager cell folds `home-manager`. Cross-class content movement is the EXPLICIT deliver/inject
  # edge, never the default fold. NO-EFFECT-RUNTIME: one attribute read + one list non-emptiness test on

  # GUARD / ADAPTARGS are EVAL-TIME transforms, NOT fold content-transforms (C7.5). v1 applies them at

  # the module ARGS through a nested `evalModules` (`nestWithAdaptArgs`, route.nix) — both need the module
  # eval environment (`args`/`config`), which the pure fold does not have. gen-edge's `adapt` has the

  # routing a v1 `adaptArgs = args: args // …` through it materializes `adaptArgs content Π`, which aborts
  # ("attempt to call something which is not a function"). So the fold carries NO `adapt`; the closures
  # ride on the declaration (`d.guard`/`d.adaptArgs`) and the trace annotations record their PRESENCE
  # (booleans — hashable, `traceEntryOf` renders `annotations`). Their active application is the terminal
