# Attribute 13 — resolved-settings (r2 §2.10 #13 / §2.7). Per `(node, aspect)` the ordered layer
# list — containment chain (gen-product) × D/I chain (gen-scope) × the terminal policy slot — folded
# by `gen-settings.resolveAll`. Every body here is WIRING (field reads, list filters, attrset
# assembly) over exactly one algorithm: the `gen-product.containmentChain` slice order and the
# `gen-settings.resolveAll` fold (Law A1). The attribute VALUE is inert data
# (`{ <aspectName> = { value; provenance; }; }`), never a loop record.
#
# STRATIFICATION LAW (A9 / A16). resolved-settings is a RESOLUTION-stratum attribute: it reads
# structure (the node's coordinates) and PRESENCE (resolved-aspects, attribute 7) — never the
# reverse. The presence fixpoint (attribute 7) never reads settings (its guards see only
# `{ pathSet, hasAspect }`, A9.1), so there is no cycle and the least fixpoint stays sound. The
# `.value` is byte-identical to a plain `foldLayers` over the same layer list (A16); provenance
# lists every layer in §2.7 order.
#
# LAYER ORDER (§2.7). `[ default ] ++ concatMap (slice: projection ++ direct) chain ++ policy`:
#   - `default`  — the schema defaults, injected by gen-settings' fold as the leading entry
#                  (defaultLabel); den-hoag emits no explicit default layer.
#   - `chain`    — `containmentChain fleet coords lin`, least→most specific; per slice the
#                  projection layers (§2.9, `via != null`) sort immediately before that slice's
#                  direct override layers (`via == null`), both from `den.settings.layers`.
#   - `policy`   — `configure` declarations at this node (attribute 4's resolution group), always in
#                  the terminal slot (A8, authority-wins by position).
#
# Deps: prelude (folds/filters), resolve (attr), product (containmentChain), settings (resolveAll),
# settingsLib (schema/layer compilation), errors (absentAspectSetting). Instance args: fleet (the
# restricted gen-product), lin (the linearization record), settingsLayers (compiled den-layer
# records), dimKinds (product dimension names, for the full-cell test).
