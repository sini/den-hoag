# SCOPE-LOCAL POLICY FIRING (board #57, ledger u3) — v1 `installPolicies` parity. v1 fires a policy ONLY
# where it is REGISTERED — scope-local, via an INCLUDE (den nix/lib/aspects/fx/policy/default.nix:82-113
# `installPolicies` "Policies fire where they're registered — scope-local only"), and the subtree fan-out
# filters by `requiredEntityArgs` (schema.nix:157-199): a `{host,…}` policy fires at HOST scopes, NOT user
# scopes (which inherit host context but are a different kind); a `{self,…}` policy fires ONCE at its own
# scope. The pre-fix shim diverged (ledger u3): every `den.policies.<name>` compiled TWICE — a fleet-wide
# GLOBAL (fires wherever its formals match ANY node) AND per-include kind arms — so an include-referenced
# policy fired at every coord-matching node, and a coord shared by a descendant kind (a user cell carries
# its host's `host` coord) made an include arm OVER-fire at the descendant. The live consequence: the
# corpus `env-to-hosts` (`{environment,…}`, a `den.schema.environment.includes` policy) fired at HOST nodes
# once `environment` was enriched there → hit the stubbed resolve fan-out. The two-part fix:
#   PART 1 — an include-referenced policy's fleet-wide GLOBAL is REMOVED; it fires via its include ARM only.
#   PART 2 — `selects` on each include arm confines it to OWNER-KIND nodes at dispatch (compile.nix
#            stamps it; concern-policies threads it onto every compiled rule; structural.nix pre-filters).
#
# The witnesses, driven through the REAL compat compile + concern-policies + structural pipeline (the same
# path the corpus takes), over hand-built roots (the b1-single-writer / compat-fleet-context convention):
#   (1) an `{environment,…}` environment-include (the env-to-hosts shape, a throwing fan-out body) does NOT
#       fire at a HOST node that CARRIES an enriched `environment` binding → the node resolves CLEAN;
#   (2) the SAME policy DOES fire at an environment-KIND node (the throw surfaces) — owner-kind, not never;
#   (3) a host-include SITE-MARK policy fires at the host but NOT at its user cell (the over-fire closed);
#   (4) the synthetic fleet-context enrich (no `selects`) STILL fires at host root AND user cell;
#   (5) [PART 1] an include-referenced policy name has NO global rule — only its `__kindInclude` arm;
#   (6) a VALUE-CONDITIONAL include's EXPANSION sub-rules each inherit the arm's `selects`.
