# product — the OPAQUE transposed flake-outputs attrset a hosted flake-parts render produces, value-nested
# verbatim like `HiveInfo` (den never type-walks it). It is framework-reserved (its name rides
# `frameworkProducts`, so `reservedNames` auto-includes it): a `consumes = "FlakeInfo"` output family compiles
# with the derived artifact mode, and a user re-registration aborts NAMED. Corpus-inert — added-but-unconsumed,
# so parity is byte-untouched (the same posture `HiveInfo` sits in). See REFERENCE.md.
