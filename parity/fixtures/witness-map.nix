# The C1 WITNESS MAP — every den v1 §2.2 surface row → its compat mechanism + a witness fixture. This is
# the machine-readable completeness ledger the C7/C8 parity harness reads as input (each fixture is a den
# v1 declaration set the harness compiles on the v2 arm AND runs through den v1 on the oracle arm). It is
# the OTHER half of surface totality: `compile`'s `unknownSurfaceKey` rejects a key the shim does NOT
# know; this map proves the shim DOES know (and witnesses) every key it claims to.
#
# Each fixture is one of:
#   • `{ decls = <v1 decl set>; pin = <suite>; runBodies ? false; legacy ? null; }` — a surface the shim
#     COMPILES. `ci/tests/compat-surface.nix` asserts `denCompat.compileFull decls` accepts it (no shim
#     rejection); `runBodies` additionally runs each compiled policy body (the effect→declaration half);
#     `pin` names the C-suite that pins the surface's DEEP semantics; `legacy` marks a surface desugared
#     by a severable legacy module (so it compiles only through `compileFull`, never bare `compile`).
#   • `{ decls = <v1 decl set>; notImplemented = { census; pointer; }; pin = <suite>; }` — a surface the
#     shim does NOT implement, deliberately (corpus-zero census). `compat-surface.nix` asserts it ABORTS
#     named (never silently absorbed), and records the census + migration pointer. The ONE such surface is
#     `den.batteries.forward` (`meta.__forward`) — PIN.md Open-Question-2.
#
# `denCompat` is threaded so the `deliver`/`route`/`provide` witnesses call the REAL surface functions
# (their bodies desugar to descriptors when run), exactly as a v1 corpus policy body does.
